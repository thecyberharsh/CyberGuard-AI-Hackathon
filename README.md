**Cybercrime Analysis Project**

Welcome to the CyberGuard AI Hackathon Project! This project was developed as part of the IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon, an initiative aimed at creating innovative AI solutions for cybersecurity and citizen safety.

**About the Project**

This project is part of IndiaAIâ€™s Application Development Initiative (IADI) and in collaboration with the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C). The initiative seeks to leverage AI for cybersecurity, particularly in managing and mitigating cyber threats for citizen welfare. With over 6,000 cases reported daily, the goal is to use advanced AI techniques to support cybercrime prevention, detection, and response.

**Project Goals**


The main goals of this project are:

To develop an AI-powered model for assisting citizens in reporting cybercrime incidents on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP).
To create real-time analysis of reported cases and incident media files.
To build a scalable and user-friendly system that aligns with IndiaAI's mission for ethical, responsible, and accessible AI.
Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Citizen Guidance: Analyzes user input to guide citizens on correctly reporting incidents.
Real-time Media File Analysis: Processes supporting files (images, videos) for quicker incident assessment.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, with accessibility features for seamless reporting.
Data Security: Adheres to strict data security measures to ensure citizen information is handled securely.
